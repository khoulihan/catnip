This project was used to generate the frames for [this animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PqFIOkhUSk). The code that performs and exports the captures is in scenes/RetroComputer.gd. the `capture_frame` and `export_frames` methods are called by a method call animation track.

Although it is unlikely to see further updates anyway, this repository has been [migrated to Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/khoulihan/catnip).
